# SchedulerApp

I successfully got the time to display and format columns on the page. I got some timeblocks to appear. I got close to coloring in the rows according to the time, using converted data and if/else/elseif logic. I started working on local storage but ultimately couldn't get that far, as well as double-checking whether the entries persist in the browswer. Thanks for taking a glance!
